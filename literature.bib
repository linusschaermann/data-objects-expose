   abstract = {Shadow IT coexists with mandated information systems. Developed and applied by non-IT domain experts, it is as a rule, but not exclusively, used for resolving non-routine issues, for which mandated IS does not have appropriate functions. Shadow IT solutions are not supported or controlled by IT departments. The aim of the paper is to show to which extent shadow IT has been researched, as this area has not yet received the necessary attention from both academia and business. A systematic literature review was conducted in order to find the papers covering the topic of shadow IT. The following electronic databases were searched: Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), Scopus (Elsevier), and AIS Electronic Library (The Association for Information Systems (AIS)). More than half of the analysed papers are case studies in one or more organizations. The papers were published mostly in scientific conferences and in scientific journals. Based on the literature review, the reasons for shadow IT occurrence, the possibility of its management are presented. Given the literature review, the author proposes a project called "illuminating" shadow IT, which would comprise three phases. The limitation of a systematic literature review is that only papers published in English are analysed.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in organizations has given rise to “Shadow AI”—the unsanctioned use of AI systems outside approved governance frameworks. While Shadow AI shares roots with Shadow IT, its generative, opaque, and autonomous nature introduces novel risks related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, hallucination, and governance drift. This study investigates Shadow AI through a mixed‐methods design, combining survey responses from 140 professionals with in‐depth interviews of 10 executives. We examine how employees perceive and justify Shadow AI, what risks it introduces in practice, and how organizational structures fail to regulate its spread. Findings reveal that while AI is widely seen as a productivity tool, governance frameworks often lag behind employee practices, leading to a “governance drift zone” where formal policies exist but lack real‐world traction. Shadow AI also exposes responsibility gaps in high‐risk functions such as HR and legal, where AI‐generated outputs may go unchecked. The study contributes to organizational and cybersecurity literature by conceptualizing Shadow AI as a sociotechnical governance failure. We propose practical strategies—such as AI tool registries, role‐specific training, internal audits, and escalation protocols—to help organizations shift from restriction to controlled enablement, allowing them to leverage AI's benefits while managing its evolving risks.},
